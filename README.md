Optical coherence tomography retinal imaging processing and Segmentation

This repository is implenmented with recent progress in the application of deep learning and other artifical intelligence methods in Ophthalmology.
Optical Coherence Tomography is a clinical applicable imaging modelity due to its high resolution (<2 um), great imaging depth (~ 2 mm) and fast imaging speed (~200 kHz, B scan).
