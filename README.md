# Optical coherence tomography retinal imaging processing and Segmentation
This repository an imlementation of recent progress in the application of deep learning and other artifical intelligence methods in Ophthalmology, especially for Optical Coherence Tomography.
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a clinical applicable imaging modelity due to its high resolution (<2 um), great imaging depth (~ 2 mm) and fast imaging speed (~200 kHz, B scan). Since the contrast of imaging is coming from the scattering effect difference for various tissue characters, OCT is mostly served as a major method to examine the structure change in retina.
Considering the natural signal-to-noise ratio is relativly low due to the omnipresent scattering in tissue, it is still challenging for physicians to distinguish different retina layers and sturcuture changes such as .
